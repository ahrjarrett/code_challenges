My solutions to various exercism problems.

*Test:*
Run `nodemon --exec jasmine-node` + the path to the directory.

*Passing:*
- Hello World
- Leap ('Additional example of a leap year that is a common leap year')
- Hamming
- Rna Transcription
- Bob
- Pangram (Using reduce)
- Phone Number
- Grade School
- ETL
- Grains (Refactor: Allow total # of squares to be passed to the function)
- Roman Numeral
- Binary (Started 04/05/17) -- However, last test (validation) does **not** pass
- Double Linked List (11/12/17) -- I think my solution is circular, too!

*Failing:*
- Gigasecond (Code doesn't run)
- Word Cound('count() counts words with quotations')
- Isogram ('Isogram Test Suite duplicates' and 'Isogram Test Suite Eleven')
- Pangram (Started 2/20/17)
- Circular Buffer (Unsolved)
- Perfect Number (Really bizarre problem with file loading? Try later â€” 04/26/17)
- Anagram (Broken 01-28-18)
